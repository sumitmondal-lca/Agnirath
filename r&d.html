                                <p>JATAYU is an innovative research project by Agnirath Aerospace and Defence Research
                                    Pvt. Ltd., developed as a hybrid system that can operate both on land and in the
                                    air. Designed as the Joint Autonomous Terrain-Aerial Yawing Unit, this cutting-edge
                                    UAV combines the stability of a ground vehicle with the versatility of an aerial
                                    platform. Its unique ability to switch between terrain navigation and flight makes
                                    it suitable for a wide range of applications, including disaster management, search
                                    and rescue, environmental monitoring, surveillance, and defense operations. On the
                                    ground, JATAYU functions as a robust, wheeled unit capable of traversing difficult
                                    landscapes, while in the air its quad-rotor system allows agile maneuvering and
                                    extended coverage. Currently under development, the project focuses on integrating
                                    advanced sensors, AI-assisted navigation, and autonomous control systems to ensure
                                    maximum adaptability in complex environments. JATAYU represents Agnirath’s vision of
                                    merging robotics, aerospace engineering, and artificial intelligence to create
                                    next-generation solutions for real-world challenges.</p>

                                        Logic MAGANLAL, or the Mars Autonomous Ground Analyzer with Navigation and
                                        Life-Assessment Logic, is Agnirath’s ambitious planetary rover project. Designed
                                        for interplanetary exploration, MAGANLAL is equipped with advanced terrain
                                        navigation systems, soil-analysis tools, and life-detection instruments. Its
                                        primary objective is to explore Martian surfaces, analyze geological formations,
                                        and assess the possibility of microbial life or habitable conditions. The
                                        rover’s AI-driven navigation system enables it to autonomously avoid obstacles,
                                        select optimal routes, and conduct experiments with minimal human intervention.
                                        MAGANLAL also incorporates advanced sensors for chemical analysis, environmental
                                        monitoring, and atmospheric studies. Beyond Mars, the design framework is
                                        adaptable for lunar and asteroid missions, making it a versatile platform for
                                        deep-space exploration. MAGANLAL embodies Agnirath’s dedication to contributing
                                        to global planetary research while simultaneously offering students and
                                        collaborators the chance to participate in real-world interplanetary
